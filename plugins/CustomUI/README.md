# CustomUI

This plugin lets you customize a few things about the Gimkit UI. Most importantly, it lets you make and use custom themes in both 1d and 2d modes.

## Installation

Click [here](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimloader/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader/main/plugins/CustomUI/build/CustomUI.js) to install the plugin with Gimloader downloaded.

## Usage

The settings menu can be accessed from the plugins menu when the plugin is enabled. There are a few things that can be changed.

1. Auto Hide Top Bar - This will make the bar at the top of the screen in 2d gamemodes slide away when you're not hovering over it.
2. Question Panel Opacity - This will change how opaque the question panel is in 2d gamemodes.
3. Custom Theme - This will let you choose a custom theme to use. This comes with all the default themes that Gimkit has, and it also has the option to make your own custom themes.
4. Home Screen Dark Mode - This will apply dark mode styles to the home screen (not in-game).
